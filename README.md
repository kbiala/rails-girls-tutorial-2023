# Rails Girls Tutorial 2023
This is Rails Girls Tutorial I use during Rails Girls workshops.

https://railsgirls.com/

Tutorial is created based on Ruby 3 and Rails 7 versions, but with only some small alterations it can be easily 
used for learning older versions as well.

Start at index.html and follow the instructions.
